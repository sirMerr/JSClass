# HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Emojis, Ajax & Cross-Browser Reliability (my favorite)

This is a full course on JavaScript for programmers and beginners. It is intended to help teach:

1. Client-side programming in a Web environment. 
2. Applying HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ajax to implement Web-based content.
3. Introduction to XML & JSON
4. Introduction to design concepts of a Web site

There are always summary notes made in crude Markdown as well as more clean pdf versions, written in Markdown and exported by our wonderful teacher, with more complete details. To see html/css/js
files in action, you can specify the path such as:

## Week 1 ðŸ˜–? Missing Weeks?!

Well Week 1 was just a 'Hi y'all welcome back to school!', so there are no notes. If there there are missing NOTES.MD or something of the like, I either didn't have notes in particular for that week or I was absent.

## NOTES.MD?

Those are the notes I took in class. You're probably better off just reading the PDFs (which I might host back to Markdown *maybe*) since I mostly just took note of small things I wanted to remember or while doing class exercises. There are some good notes that include review questions though so look out for that. 

## Cross-Browser Reliability?
Yup! Google might have dropped its support of IE8, BUT WE SURE HAVEN'T! To be fair, it's pretty interesting to know how to make certain things cross-browser reliable and I'm happy to have that in my information bank. On the other hand, IE.

I did very little testing on older browsers, but it should work about the same ðŸ˜„.

**Some of the content isn't as clean as I'd like it to be right now unfortunately, but it contains solid material and a pretty clear structure.**
